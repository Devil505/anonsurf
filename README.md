# SOLUS ANONYMOUS MODE

#### WORK IN PROGRESS

The idea is to provide a strong system-wide anonymization module for SOLUS operating system.

Fork of Anonsurf, Parrot's anonymous mode to force connections through tor and/or the i2p network.


Depends: dnsmasq, tor, iptables, zenity

depends needed with Solus: resolvconf, i2p
